Regional language Translation:-This system uses a fine-tuned NLLB-200 model to translate Bhojpuri and Maithili into Hindi or English, followed by a fine-tuned mBART model for summarization. The pipeline is implemented in PyTorch and deployed using a Gradio interface, allowing users to translate and summarize regional language text in a single step.
